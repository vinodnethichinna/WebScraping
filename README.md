Web Scraping using Python.

In this we are going to scrape news website and extract information like heading and description from news articles. This acts as data collection steps for
different data science projects. I used this to collect input data for my "Fake News Detection" Project.

Here i used my choice of news URL, please make sure you change the target URL as required. Once data collected we are also exporting data to MONGO DB.
